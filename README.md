# VSCode Font Patch

A command line utility to patch a Visual Studio Code installation on **Windows**, which does two things:

- slightly enhances the font rendering;
- fixes the autocomplete icon color ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/q/68321114/6923555)).

Written in C++20 with [WinDlg](https://github.com/rodrigocfd/windlg).

## Usage

Close VSCode and run the application.

When opening VSCode again, you will see a warning about a corrupted installation. If you don't ignore it, the changes made by the patch will be reverted.

To revert the patch, simply run VS Code installer again.
